I don't think people can learn past a certain point without doing.

doing is the act of falsifying your own bad assumptions.

lots of times I've heard:

- I need to think through things more before testing anything out
- I'm not good enough to start trying things
- I could never do that without any help

but these are almost always just excuses for being lazy.

the fastest way to learn is to have tight feedback loops, and to iterate an enormous amount.

don't do tutorials, just flounder for a while and actually *learn*.

tutorials keep you in a state of thinking you know something without actually doing.

do you think a master chef learned how to make recipes by following 1000 recipes?

no, a master chef will experiment thousands of times and *learns how to cook*.

stop being lazy.

go do something.
